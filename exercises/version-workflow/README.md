# Exercise #1: Versioning Workflows with the Patching API

During this exercise, you will

- Run a Workflow Execution that completes successfully
- Make and deploy a change that does not affect compatibility
- Make and deploy a change that breaks compatibility, causing a non-deterministic error
- Develop an automated test to check compatibility with previous executions
- Use the Patching API to implement versioning for the Workflow

Make your changes to the code in the `practice` subdirectory (look for
`TODO` comments that will guide you to where you should make changes to
the code). If you need a hint or want to verify your changes, look at
the complete version in the `solution` subdirectory.

## Setup

You'll need two terminal windows for this exercise.

1. In all terminals, change to the `exercises/version-workflow/practice` directory.
2. In one terminal, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Part A: Run a Workflow to Completion

1. In one terminal, run `npm start` to start the Worker
2. In a second terminal, run `npm run workflow a100`. This will
   start a Workflow that processes the loan for customer ID `a100`.
3. Let this Workflow run to completion. This customer has a loan
   with 10 payments, and since the Workflow in this exercise uses
   a Timer to add a three-second delay between each payment, it
   should complete within 30 seconds.
4. You will now download the history of this execution in JSON
   format so that you can replay it in an automated test that
   you will develop later in this exercise. Open the Web UI,
   navigate to the detail page for this execution, and then click
   the **Download** button that appears on the right side of the
   page, just above the table showing the Event History.
   Save the file as `history_for_original_execution.json` in your
   `practice` directory.
   - NOTE: If you are running this exercise in GitPod, you may
     be unable to download the file, due to the embedded browser
     used in that environment. In this case, run the following
     command from the `practice` directory:
     `temporal workflow show \
 --workflow-id loan-processing-workflow-customer-a100 \
 --fields long \
 --output json > history_for_original_execution.json`
     to retrieve a copy.
5. In the next section, you will make and deploy an incompatible
   change, causing a non-deterministic error for an open execution.
   To allow time for you to do these things, edit the `src/workflows.ts`
   file and change the duration in the `await sleep` call from
   `3 seconds` to `90 seconds`.
6. Save your change to the `src/workflows.ts` file and exit the editor
7. Restart the Worker by pressing Ctrl-C in the terminal window
   from step 1 and running the `npm start` command again
8. Run the Workflow again: `npm run workflow a100`
9. Use the Web UI to verify that the Workflow Execution from the
   previous step is running before proceeding with the next part
   of this exercise.

## Part B: Deploy an Incompatible Change (without Versioning)

1. This Workflow uses the `sendThankYouToCustomer` Activity to
   send a thank you message to the customer before charging
   them with the first loan payment, but this was a mistake.
   This Activity should run after the last payment, so move  
   this call from just before the loop to just after the loop.
2. Save your change and exit the editor.
3. Restart the Worker by pressing Ctrl-C in the terminal
   window where you started it and then running the
   `npm start` command again. The change you just
   made to the Workflow logic takes effect immediately, although
   the Worker immediately begins using the updated code you
   deployed, it may take up to 90 seconds before that is
   evident for this Workflow Execution, due to the duration of
   the Timer.
4. Refresh the detail page for this execution in the Web UI.
   Continue to refresh the page until the non-deterministic
   error is visible.

The non-deterministic error occurs because of your change to the
Workflow logic. By moving the Activity from before the loop to after
it, the sequence of Commands generated during execution is different
with the new code than it was prior to the change.

Recall that you had an open Workflow Execution when you restarted the
Worker during the deployment. The Worker used History Replay to
recover the state of the open execution prior to the restart. Since
the Commands generated when replaying it with the new code did not
correspond to the Events that were generated when the Worker ran the
original code before the restart, it is unable to recover the state
and responds by throwing the non-deterministic error you see.

## Part C: Use the Workflow Replayer to Test Compatibility

1. In the Web UI, navigate to the detail page for the Workflow
   Execution that completed during Part A of this exercise.
2. Edit the `mocha/workflows.test.ts` file and implement the following
   in the `successfully replays Workflow history from file` function:
   - Read the history file and parse it as JSON
   - Use the `Workflow.runReplayHistory` function, pass it the `WorkflowPath` and the history file.
3. Save your changes
4. Run `npm test`. You should find that this fails, which confirms
   altering the execution order of the `sendThankYouToCustomer`
   Activity breaks compatibility. In the final part of this
   exercise, you will use the Patching API to implement
   versioning for your change, thereby making it compatible
   with Workflow Executions started before or after the change.

## Part D: Version the Change with the Patching API

Open `src/workflows.ts`.

At the top of the file, import the Patching API:

```ts
import { patched } from "@temporalio/workflow";
```

Just above the loop, where the `sendThankYouToCustomer` call was prior to
the change, add the following code:

```ts
if (!patched("MovedThankYouAfterLoop")) {
  await sendThankYouToCustomer(input);
}
```

This establishes a logical branch for code execution, identified
by the user-defined Patch ID `MovedThankYouAfterLoop`.

Now wrap the code you previously moved after the loop in a
conditional statement that tests if `patched` is equal to
`MovedThankYouAfterLoop`. This will handle the Activity for Workflow
Executions started after the change.

Now do the following tasks to complete the exercise:

1. Change the duration of the `await sleep` statement at the
   bottom of the loop back to 3 seconds. This is unrelated to
   versioning, but will help you see the results more quickly.
2. Run `npm test` again. You should find it succeeds this time,
   since you've used the Patching API to restore compatibility with
   the previous execution.
3. Restart the Worker by pressing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal
   window where you started it and then running the `npm start` command again.
4. Return to the detail page for this Workflow Execution.

### This is the end of the exercise.
